-- | Javascript code for ghcjs build of cardano-addresses.
--   
--   This package supports ghcjs compilation of cardano-addresses with
--   Javascript wrappers and Emscripten builds of the cryptonite C sources.
@package cardano-addresses-jsbits
@version 3.12.0


-- | GHCJS compatibility support.
module Cardano.Address.Jsbits

-- | This function does nothing except convince GHC that there is a
--   dependency on the cardano-addresses-jsbits package.
--   
--   This workaround will make sure that GHCJS includes the <tt>.js</tt>
--   files from this package when linking.
--   
--   For non-GHCJS it really does nothing.
